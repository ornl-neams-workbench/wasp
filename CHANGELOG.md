## [4.3.0] - 5-03-2024

### Added
- LSP client and server support for both sending and receiving document hover text requests and responses
- Python WaspNode.source method to provide access to stream or file path originating the node

### Changed

## [4.2.0] - 2-19-2024

### Added

- HIT error recovery for partial block such that parse tree construction resumes if possible, but parse failures are still captured
- Convenience function is_nested_file that checks if any NodeView is file include
- BLANK_LINE enum type and NodeView::set_type method to set type for any NodeView
- HITNodeView::token_type method to return the type of the backing token or UNKNOWN for non-terminal or out-of-range requests
